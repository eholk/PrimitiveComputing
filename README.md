# Primitive Computing

Primitive Computing is a live-streamed coding project where I am attempting to
build a self-hosted operating system and programming language starting with
just an assembler. This repository will include the code, and perhaps other
notes and related documentation.

Recordings of my live-stream sessions will be posted to the [Primitive
Computing
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtMVie2KRPsOvkdrLLwmISc6uul-x4XuZ)
on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/EricHolk).
